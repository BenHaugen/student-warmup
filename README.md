# Student Warmup

Your task will be to re-create the following gifs using React: 

![controlled input](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5df57bde30bed0fe8d370ba59001f64baaf3639d/687474703a2f2f672e7265636f726469742e636f2f586f544c7068314851492e676966)

![no x](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b325a2f24632bf2e1b52ca7fbbfa7fe9b02c9348/687474703a2f2f672e7265636f726469742e636f2f5861424e586d375673562e676966)

For the first gif, a simple text input that renders text to the DOM as your type. For the second, modify the same input field to not accept the character 'x'. 

You should be able to accomplish this with your knowledge of events, props, and state.
